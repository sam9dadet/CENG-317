# BME280 TEMPERATURE APP
Implementing the BME280 temperature sensor with a Pi 3

## Build Instructions
Building a bme 280 below as follows:

You have to make a project for school or just looking for a hobby to do during the weekend then the BME 280 temperature app is for you. 

##Items Required:
a) Raspberry pi
b) BME 280 Sensor Adafruit or Sparkfun either works fine.
c) Breadboard
d)jumper wires 
e) micro sd card
f) RJ-45 Cable
g) acyclic enclosure (housing for your case)

The steps i would be describing below would be very easy and simple to follow. 

##Proposal/Scheduling
Follow the link to see how long it took me to make this project. In the real world it should take a weekend to do this project, pending if and when you have all your parts, downloading your OS, made your PCB and your acrylic case.
