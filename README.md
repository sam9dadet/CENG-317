## Introduction 
You have to make a project for your science class in  school or just looking for a hobby to do during the weekend then the BME 280 sensor is for you. 

The BME280 is a humidity, pressure and temperature sensor that has fast response time and high overall accuracy. and in this project we would be implementing it, using a raspberry pi. together you have your own personal "weather device". 

## Build Instructions
Building a bme 280 below as follows:

# Material Required 

## Items Required: 
a) Raspberry pi
b) BME 280 Sensor Adafruit or Sparkfun either works fine.
c) Breadboard
d)jumper wires 
e) micro sd card
f) RJ-45 Cable
g) acyclic enclosure (housing for your case)

# Budget
The cost of this project was a dollar short of $180 CAD less than 200 dollars. thats a pretty decent amount for this type of project.
the link to the budget, revealing detailed amount for each item can be found [here](insert link to budget here ) 


## Time Commitment
this project personally took me 15 week to do in a span of 3 hours each day and that's because it was technically an inclass project but doing this outside of school or as a hobby like i stated above, it should take you an average of a weekend pending if you havee all your parts and source code before starting.

# Mechanical Assembly

The steps i would be describing below would be very easy and simple to follow. 

## Proposal/Scheduling
Follow the link to see how long it took me to make this project. In the real world it should take a weekend to do this project, pending if and when you have all your parts, downloading your OS, made your PCB and your acrylic case.
