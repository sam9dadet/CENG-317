Vlad eventually printed out my pcb find attachged image below

Today was suppose to be the when we run our sensor on the terminal to output it's intended data but i tried testing my sensor with various python codes relating to the bme 280 [bme.py](https://xdevs.com/guide/thp_rpi/) but i couldnt get it to work .

i even tried to run a code from the sensehat [sensehat_bme](https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/blob/master/firmware/BME280.py) which required editing of the code since the code comprised of various other sensors . i did that but still couldnt get it to work . 
i plan on working on it this weekend .

Today in class was suppose to be the etching  of the pcb onto the rapberry pi but vlad who works at the prototype lab didnt get my files so i had to resend them and it was going to take atleast 2 days to get it printed. 
 
 I am going to work on still configuring my raspberry pi , and in regards to my [budget](https://github.com/sam9dadet/CENG-317/blob/master/BME280%20image%20files%20and%20link/Budget%20for%20BME280%20Sensor.xlsx) nothing has changed.

I was able to solder my bme 280 sensor at the prototyping lab with the help of kelly . I have never soldered anything in my entire and he assisted me grealty with some huge tips about soldering. 

after i was done soldering, i  completed a milestone which was viewing the i2c address of your sensor. mind you i was weeks behing due to the fact that my sensor hasnt arrived but with the help of [this website](http://cactus.io/hookups/sensors/barometric/bme280/hookup-arduino-to-bme280-barometric-pressure-sensor) .

## 31/11/2018
Sensor finally arrived , which has set me back by 3 weeks . but with many commited hours in the library i was able to catch up and also just a few adjustment to my project timeline. please see link below

Below is an image of my sensor wired with the breadboard.

## 30/10/2018 
I was able to design the  schematic for my sensor using the fritzing tool . although sensor hasn't arrived , i can design how my sensor would look like on the fritzing tool . and also produce the pcb diagram for my sensor to avoid using wires . please find attached  images below. also i got help from [this website](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2016/07/using-bme280-i2c-temperature-pressure-sensor-in-python/) also they used a sparkfun bme and mine was an adafruit they function in the same way. wiring the same just a few changed names on both sensor.

## 23/10/2018 
Sensor hasn't arrived, so i was unable to do the breadboarding milestone and no changes in finances. 
take a look at my budget to verify no changes to my finances [budget](https://github.com/sam9dadet/CENG-317/blob/master/BME280%20image%20files%20and%20link/Budget%20for%20BME280%20Sensor.xlsx)

I was able to program my raspberry pi to connect to the school network via ethernet rather than wi-fi.
