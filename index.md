vlad eventually printed out my pcb find attachged image below

today was suppose to be the when we run our sensor on the terminal to output it's intended data but i tried testing my sensor with various python codes relating to the bme 280 ![bme.py](insert link here ) but i couldnt get it to work . i even tried to run a code from the sensehat which required editing of the code since the code comprised of various other sensors . i did that but still couldnt get it to work . 
i plan on working on it this weekend .

The project is going as per schedule. I have started working on my next week requirements which is to have a case designned for my rpi and sensor. I will be using corel draw for the design part.

Today in class was suppose to be the etching  of the pcb onto the rapberry pi but vlad who works at the prototype lab didnt get my files so i had to resend them and it was going to take atleast 2 days to get it printed. 
 so i am going to work on still configuring my raspberry pi , and in regards to my [budget]

i was able to solder my bme 280 sensor at the prototyping lab with the help of kelly . I have never soldered anything in my entire and he assisted me grealty with some huge tips about soldering. 

after i was done soldering i also completed a milestone which was viewing the i2c address of your sensor. mind you i was weeks behing due to the fact that my sensor hasnt arrived but with the help of ![this website](link here] i was able to figure out how to check the i2c address of my sensor
solddering of my bme 280 sensor  and also changing the i2c address .

sensor finally arrived , which has set me back by 3 weeks . but with many commited hours in the library i was able to catch up and also just a few adjustment to my project timeline. please see link below

i was able to design the  schmatic for my sensor using te fritzing tool . although sensor hasn't arrived , i can design how my sensor would look like on the fritzing tool . and also produce the pcb diagram for my sensor to avoid using wires . please find attached  images below. also i got help from ![this website](insert link here) also they used a sparkfun bme and mine was an adafruit they function in the same way. wiring the same just a few changed names on both sensor.

sensor hasn't arrived, so i was unable to do the breadboarding milestone and no changes in finances. 
take a look at my budget to verify no changes to my finances ![budget](insert budget link here )

i was able to program my raspberry pi to connect to the school network via ethernet rather than wi-fi.
